# Asteroids measurements & (future) discoveries by Michal Biesiada

The project is inspired by SOHO comets [discoveries-biesiada](https://github.com/mbiesiad/discoveries-biesiada) & [Supernova](https://github.com/mbiesiad/supernovas-biesiada).

The main goal of this project is to be a data backup for me in this case. ‚≠ê I'm focusing here on [TOTAS](https://totas.cosmos.esa.int/) project supported by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/). I suppose it will be quite useful for me, I mean organize & backup the data. ‚≠ê

- [Movers (discovery candidates - OGS designation)](https://github.com/mbiesiad/asteroids-biesiada/blob/main/tables/details-movers-1.csv)
- [Movers (manually created discovery candidates - OGS designation)](https://github.com/mbiesiad/asteroids-biesiada/blob/main/tables/details-movers-2.csv)

This time, no ToC or CoC. That's rather 'personal' stuff. A lot of people are interested and courious about the Project, so I hope I helped.
I could make another site or something, but I really appreciate a GitHub tables' appearance. :octocat: :octocat:

I try support the tech & science as well as I can.

I dedicate these (future I hope) discoveries to my Family & Friends which support me all the ways!
